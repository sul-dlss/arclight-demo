          <p>Series 1: Flour includes publications from a range of companies promoting flour
            products. Most publications focus on recipes for sweet baked goods, such as cake, pie,
            quickbreads, and cookies, but some provide recipes for sandwiches or other savory
            dishes. Although the inclusive dates are 1869-2002, most publications date from the
            1910s-1970s. In addition to numerous flour companies, including Robin Hood Flour Mills,
            Washburn Crosby Company, and King Arthur Flour, among others, this series includes
            publications from corporations that produced both flour and baking mixes, such as
            various iterations of the Pillsbury company.</p>

          <p> There is stronger late-19th and early-20th century representation among those focused
            on baking powder, with most publications dating from the 1890s-1940s. Some notable
            corporate authors include Calumet Baking Powder Company, Cleveland Baking Powder
            Company, Davis Baking Powder Company, Pure Baking Powder Co., Royal Baking Powder
            Company, Rumford Baking Powder Col, and Warner Baking Powder Company.</p>
          <p> Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is less-well represented, but notable publications
            include numerous titles from the 1900s-1930s promoting Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda,
            including editions of Arm &amp; Hammer Soda Book of Valuable Recipes, Friend in Need:
            Facts Worth Knowing about Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda as a Proven Medicinal Agent, and
            Good Things to Eat Made with Arm &amp; Hammer.</p>
